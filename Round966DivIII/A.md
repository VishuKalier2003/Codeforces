### Problem Description

Dmitry wrote down several integers on a board, but missed a crucial notation while writing an important integer `n`. The integer `n` should have been of the form `10^x` (with `x ≥ 2`), but Dmitry accidentally omitted the `^` symbol, potentially transforming `10^5` (100000) into `105` or `10^19` (a very large number) into `1019`. 

Given `t` integers, the task is to determine if each integer on the board could potentially represent a valid form of `10^x` in this erroneous notation or not.

**Input:**  
1. An integer `t` (1 ≤ t ≤ 10^4), representing the number of integers written on the board.
2. Each of the next `t` lines contains an integer `a` (1 ≤ a ≤ 10000), representing an integer from the board.

**Output:**  
For each integer, output `"YES"` if it could represent `10^x` without the exponent symbol, or `"NO"` otherwise.

### Intuition

1. **Structure of `10^x` Numbers**: Any valid representation of `10^x` should resemble "10x" in some form. This means:
   - The number should begin with the digits "10" to imply `10^`.
   - The subsequent characters after "10" should resemble a valid power, typically `10x`, where `x` is two or more, to avoid trivial powers.

2. **Excluded Forms**:
   - Small numbers (e.g., below 100) are excluded, as they don’t have enough digits to imply `10^x` for `x ≥ 2`.
   - Numbers like `101` and `1002`, which don’t follow the `10^x` form due to trailing zeros or leading characters after "10" that imply invalid powers, should be excluded.
  
3. **Using String Conversion for Pattern Recognition**:
   - Converting each integer to a string allows us to efficiently check if it begins with "10" and assess the format of the remaining characters for potential validity.

---

### Observations from Test Cases

1. **Case for Exclusion (Small Numbers)**:
   - Numbers below 100 or those that do not start with "10" can be ruled out instantly, e.g., `100` and `101`. These either lack enough digits to represent `10^x` (with `x ≥ 2`) or do not align with the `10x` structure.
  
2. **Valid Cases (Following "10x" Pattern)**:
   - Numbers like `1010` and `1019` fit the desired pattern because they start with "10" and have a non-trivial sequence of digits afterward, which could imply a high power.

3. **Cases with Trailing Zeros or Anomalies**:
   - Numbers like `1002` start with "10" but don’t form a proper power representation after the "10" sequence, suggesting they are not valid forms.

### Expected Time Complexity

Given the constraints (`t ≤ 10^4` and `a ≤ 10000`), we aim for an efficient `O(t)` solution, where each integer is assessed in constant time using string manipulation.

---

### Code Explanation

The code is divided into two functions: `main` for handling input and output, and `importantNumber` for checking if each number could represent a missing exponent form of `10^x`.

---

#### Code Explanation: `main` function

```java
public static void main(String args[]) {
    Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
    // Input Area...
    int t = sc.nextInt();
    int nums[] = new int[t];
    for(int i = 0; i < t; i++)
        nums[i] = sc.nextInt();
    // Output loop...
    for(int i = 0; i < t; i++)
        System.out.println(importantNumber(nums[i]) ? "YES" : "NO");
    sc.close();
}
```

1. **Input Handling**:
   - Reads the integer `t` (number of integers) and stores each integer in an array `nums`.
   
2. **Output Loop**:
   - For each integer in `nums`, it calls `importantNumber` to check if the integer could represent `10^x` without the `^` symbol.
   
3. **Result Display**:
   - Prints `"YES"` if the integer matches the `10^x` pattern; otherwise, it prints `"NO"`.

**Time Complexity:** `O(t)`, where `t` is the number of integers to process, as it evaluates each integer once.

**Space Complexity:** `O(t)`, as it stores all integers in an array.

#### Code Explanation: `importantNumber` function

```java
public static boolean importantNumber(int num) {
    if(num <= 10)   return false;       // If number is less than 10...
    String s = String.valueOf(num);
    if(!s.substring(0, 2).equals("10")) return false;   // If not a power of 10...
    // If a three digit number with power 0 or 1...
    if(s.length() == 3 && (s.charAt(2) == '1' || s.charAt(2) == '0'))    return false;
    // If the power starts with a 0...
    if(s.length() > 3 && s.charAt(2) == '0')    return false;
    return true;
}
```

1. **Initial Check (Line 1)**:
   - If `num` is less than or equal to 10, it’s instantly ruled out, as it cannot represent `10^x` with `x ≥ 2`.

2. **String Conversion (Line 2)**:
   - Converts `num` to a string for easier character-based checks.

3. **Prefix Check (Line 3)**:
   - Ensures the number starts with "10" to simulate `10^`. If it doesn’t, it returns `false`.

4. **Three-Digit Check (Line 4)**:
   - If the integer has three digits, it checks if the last digit is `0` or `1`. If true, it returns `false` as it does not align with the expected pattern.

5. **Trailing Zero Check (Line 5)**:
   - For numbers longer than three digits, it ensures the third character isn’t `0`, as that would invalidate the format.

**Time Complexity:** `O(d)`, where `d` is the number of digits in `num`. Since `num ≤ 10000`, `d` is constant and at most 5, making this function effectively `O(1)` for each integer.

**Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as it only uses a constant amount of additional space.

### Overall Complexity

- **Time Complexity of Solution:** `O(t)`, as each integer is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity of Solution:** `O(t)`, due to storing `t` integers in an array.
